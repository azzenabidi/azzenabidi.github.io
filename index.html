                I was honored to have Azzen as my mentor during the Founder
                Institute program. He played an important role in the ideation
                phase of my startup and guided me to success. I was delighted to
                see how much Azzen invests in the entrepreneurs he coaches. He
                took the time to understand my company's vision, challenges and
                goals, and provided tailored advice that always exceeded my
                expectations. As a growth marketing specialist, Azzen helped me
                a lot with the GTM strategy, but he was also very involved in
                all aspects of my business. He's always there when you need him,
                and he didn't just offer his expertise, he also put me in touch
                with people in his network who were also very helpful. If you're
                looking for a dedicated and competent mentor in the startup
                ecosystem, look no further.

                I had the privilege of working with Azzen for more than two
                years at Veamly, where we collaborated on various projects and
                tasks. During that time, I had the chance to get to know him
                personally and professionally. Azzen is not just a coworker, but
                also more like a brother to me. As a growth marketing
                specialist, Azzen has a unique combination of technical
                expertise, programming and marketing know-how. During the time
                as Azzenâ€™s co-worker, he has a proven track record of driving
                growth and revenue for Veamly. Azzen is a true growth hacker,
                beyond his impressive technical skills, he is also a strategic
                thinker and a great mentor. He has a unique ability to connect
                with people, build relationships, and inspire others to reach
                their full potential. I would highly recommend Azzen as a growth
                marketing specialist, and inspiring leader. If you're looking
                for someone who can help you drive growth and revenue for your
                organization, Azzen is the right person for you.

                Azzen is a powerhouse of thoughtful, creative, and empathetic
                energy. He is a people-person that can connect with anyone! I
                have reached out to him, on several occasions, for advice on
                career paths, work skills, and startup ideas - and his feedback
                has always been well-thought-out, actionable, and humane. He's
                still one of the smartest people I've met - always taking the
                time to break down complex concepts and ideas I didn't
                understand. No matter how complex the problem is, he will always
                come up with a brilliant, elegant, and simple solution. Azzen is
                fantastic to work with and has outstanding experience in helping
                me gain clarity in my career path. He has a unique ability to
                build interpersonal relations with others. Azzen is a person
                with great skills and profound experience in modern business
                solutions. In addition, a reliable and forward-thinking mentor I
                definitely would recommend him as a mentor.

                of the wisest mentors I had the pleasure of working with during
                the FI journey. He had been always offering new ideas throughout
                the program and never hesitated to share his brilliant growth
                hacks. Whenever I faced difficulty in my buisness, I had always
                taken his opinion to overcome my challenges. He is also known
                for his determination and dedication. We all have learned a lot
                from him. On a personal level, he has always motivated,
                supported and guided me through difficult times in this
                challenging field and he did so in a way that was easy to
                understand and digest.
