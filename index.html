I was honored to have Azzen as my mentor during the Founder Institute program. He played an important role in the ideation phase of my startup and guided me to success.

I was delighted to see how much Azzen invests in the entrepreneurs he coaches. He took the time to understand my company's vision, challenges and goals, and provided tailored advice that always exceeded my expectations. 

As a growth marketing specialist, Azzen helped me a lot with the GTM strategy, but he was also very involved in all aspects of my business. He's always there when you need him, and he didn't just offer his expertise, he also put me in touch with people in his network who were also very helpful. 

If you're looking for a dedicated and competent mentor in the startup ecosystem, look no further.

            Reflecting on our startup (DEAF SQUARE) journey, I realize that I owe part of it to the guidance and support of Azzen Abidi. With his expertise and insights, he's helped me develop my startup idea and perfecting my pitch deck, making it possible for me to pursue my dream of creating a solution that will benefit the Deaf community.

I am truly grateful for his generosity in sharing his time and knowledge with me during our startup incubation in the Founder Institute Tunisia. His mentorship has not only helped me build a stronger business foundation but also enabled me to develop as a leader and entrepreneur.

To all those who are fortunate enough to have a great mentor in their life, take a moment to thank them for their invaluable guidance. It can make all the difference in your journey to success.

            I had the wonderful opportunity to be mentored by Azzen recently, and I can confidently say that it was a game-changer for me. As a technical founder, I found myself lacking in crucial areas like marketing, lead generation, sales, and branding.

Azzen's background in engineering before transitioning to growth marketing made him the ideal mentor for me. His ability to seamlessly navigate both worlds ensured that our communication was not just effective but also incredibly insightful.

What truly stood out to me during our mentorship was Azzen's knack for storytelling. He had this remarkable way of using stories to explain complex concepts, which made everything just click for me. And on top of that, he was always ready to share valuable resources, enriching our sessions even further.

If you're seeking guidance I wholeheartedly recommend connecting with Azzen. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!
